# My Development Environment

## Description

Most of my development is done in Clojure, ClojureScript, Python, and Go on
MacOS, Debian, Alpine, and Amazon Linux. I occasionally use Emacs and JetBrain
products, but I find that combination of vim, tmux, zsh, and other unix command
line utilities is the most efficient for my workflow. This repository contains
my "dot files".
